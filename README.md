## Nifty50-Price-prediction-using-LSTM-and-GRU

#### Data Loading and Preprocessing: The code loads NIFTY50 stock data from a CSV file, converts the ‘Date’ column to datetime format, and resamples the data to business days.
#### Data Normalization and Splitting: The data is normalized using MinMaxScaler and split into training and testing sets.
#### LSTM and GRU Model Creation: An LSTM and GRU model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, trained on the data, and evaluated for performance using metrics like RMSE.
